## 0.2 (2013-07-07)

* Upgraded to mirror changes in KnpMenu.  Now requires KnpMenu 2.0.*@dev.
  As more stable versions are released, I will change the stability
  requirements.
* [BC break] Renamed configuration option `menu_item_repository` to `menu_item_entity`
* Removed deprecated tests, and added a few simple tests.
* [BC break] Removed (mostly) useless preload option.

## 0.1 (2013-06-22)

* First workable version.
* Added tests.
